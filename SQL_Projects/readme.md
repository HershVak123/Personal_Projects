# SQL Projects
The projects in this folder are the two projects required for the Udacity SQL Nanodegree.

### Project 1: Deforestation Exploration
The goal of this project was to give a report of the forestation levels of the different regions of the world.
SQL queries (listed in the appendix of the file) are used to obtain the relevant values.

### Project 2: Udiddit, a social news aggregator
The goal of this project was to take an existing database schema filled with data and perform the following tasks:
1. Create a new database schema that normalizes the data
2. Use DML/DQL to migrate data from the old schema to the new schema.
3. Add the proper constraints and indexes to ensure the validity of the data as well as optimize the performance
of search queries.
