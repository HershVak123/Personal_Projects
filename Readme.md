# Personal Projects Repository
This repository contains various data science-related projects I took part in between 2017-2020.

## Projects:

#### AirBNB Seattle Data set:
This project takes a look at AirBNB data from Seattle, Washington. The main focus is seeing if there is a model that can
predict rating based on certain variables contained within the data set.

#### Chicago Health Inspection data:
This project was my final project for the General Assembly Data Science program. The data set used in this analysis is
one containing health inspection data for various eateries in the Chicago area. My goal was to see if zip code was a predictor
of how likely a restaurant is to fail a health inspection.

#### Election Data Analysis:
This project takes a look at various statistics surrounding the 2012 US Presidential election. The goal here was to
create visualizations to provide insights surrounding how much funding candidates received and other questions surrounding that.

#### Stock Market Data:
Similar to the Election Data analysis, the goal of this project was to visualize relationships within the data using 
univariate and bivariate graphs.
