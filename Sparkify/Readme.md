# Sparkify Capstone Project

### Overview
This project is one option for the capstone project for Udacity's Data Science NanoDegree program.
The goal of this project is to use a data set for the imaginary service "Sparkify" and predict
user churn by building a functional ETL pipeline.

**Problem Statement**: Companies often look for ways to reduce user churn (a customer ceasing
usage of a product/service). With a large data set available, is it possible to create
a a process that will model the data and bring to light major factors that accurately
predict user churn.
